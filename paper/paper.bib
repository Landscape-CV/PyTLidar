ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new method for constructing quickly and automatically precision tree models from point clouds of the trunk and branches obtained by terrestrial laser scanning. The input of the method is a point cloud of a single tree scanned from multiple positions. The surface of the visible parts of the tree is robustly reconstructed by making a flexible cylinder model of the tree. The thorough quantitative model records also the topological branching structure. In this paper, every major step of the whole model reconstruction process, from the input to the finished model, is presented in detail. The model is constructed by a local approach in which the point cloud is covered with small sets corresponding to connected surface patches in the tree surface. The neighbor-relations and geometrical properties of these cover sets are used to reconstruct the details of the tree and, step by step, the whole tree. The point cloud and the sets are segmented into branches, after which the branches are modeled as collections of cylinders. From the model, the branching structure and size properties, such as volume and branch size distributions, for the whole tree or some of its parts, can be approximated. The approach is validated using both measured and modeled terrestrial laser scanner data from real trees and detailed 3D models. The results show that the method allows an easy extraction of various tree attributes from terrestrial or mobile laser scanning point clouds.},

  ABSTRACT = {An open source tool named SimpleTree, capable of modelling highly accurate cylindrical tree models from terrestrial laser scan point clouds, is presented and evaluated. All important functionalities, accessible in the software via buttons and dialogues, are described including the explanation of all necessary input parameters. The method is validated utilizing 101 point clouds of six different tree species, in the main evergreen and coniferous trees. All scanned trees have been destructively harvested to get accurate estimates of above ground biomass with which we assess the accuracy of the SimpleTree-reconstructed cylinder models. The trees were grouped into four data sets and for each one a Concordance Correlation Coefficient of at least 0.92 (0.92, 0.97, 0.92, 0.94) and an total relative error at most ~8 % (2.42%, 3.59%, –4.59%, 8.27%) was achieved in the comparison of the model results to the ground truth data. A global statistical improvement of derived cylinder radii is presented as well as an efficient optimization approach to automatically improve user given input parameters. An additional check of the SimpleTree results is presented via comparison to the results of trees reconstructed using an alternative, published method.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a method for fitting cylinders into a point cloud, derived from a terrestrial laser-scanned tree. Utilizing high scan quality data as the input, the resulting models describe the branching structure of the tree, capable of detecting branches with a diameter smaller than a centimeter. The cylinders are stored as a hierarchical tree-like data structure encapsulating parent-child neighbor relations and incorporating the tree’s direction of growth. This structure enables the efficient extraction of tree components, such as the stem or a single branch. The method was validated both by applying a comparison of the resulting cylinder models with ground truth data and by an analysis between the input point clouds and the models. Tree models were accomplished representing more than 99% of the input point cloud, with an average distance from the cylinder model to the point cloud within sub-millimeter accuracy. After validation, the method was applied to build two allometric models based on 24 tree point clouds as an example of the application. Computation terminated successfully within less than 30 min. For the model predicting the total above ground volume, the coefficient of determination was 0.965, showing the high potential of terrestrial laser-scanning for forest inventories.},

  ABSTRACT = {One way to model a tree is to use a collection of geometric primitives to represent the surface and topology of the stem and branches of a tree. The circular cylinder is often used as the geometric primitive, but it is not the only possible choice. We investigate various geometric primitives and modelling schemes, discuss their properties and give practical estimates for expected modelling errors associated with the primitives. We find that the circular cylinder is the most robust primitive in the sense of a well-bounded volumetric modelling error, even with noise and gaps in the data. Its use does not cause errors significantly larger than those with more complex primitives, while the latter are much more sensitive to data quality. However, in some cases, a hybrid approach with more complex primitives for the stem is useful.},

abstract = {Fast and automated collection of forest data, such as species composition information, is required to support climate mitigation actions. Recently, there have been significant advances in the use of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) instruments, which facilitate the capture of detailed forest structure. However, for tree species recognition the structural information from TLS has mainly been used to complement spectral information. TLS-only classification studies have been limited in size and diversity of plot forest types. In this paper, we investigate the potential of TLS for tree species classification. We used quantitative structure models to determine 17 structural tree features. These features were computed for 758 trees of five tree species, including two understory species, of a 1.4 hectare mixed deciduous forest plot. Three classification methods were compared: k-nearest neighbours, multinomial logistic regression and support vector machine. We assessed the potential underlying causes for structural differences with principal component analysis. We obtained classification success rates of approximately 80%, however, with producer accuracies for three of the five species ranging from 0 to 60%. Low producer accuracies were the result of a high intra- and low inter-species variability. These effects were, respectively, caused by a high size-dependency of the structural features and a convergence of structural traits across species as a result of the individual tree position in the forest canopy and shade tolerance. Nevertheless, the producer accuracies could be improved through sensitivity vs. specificity trade-offs, with over 50% for all species being obtainable. The high intra -and low inter-species variability complicate the classification. Furthermore, the classification performance and best classification method greatly depend on its targeted application. In conclusion, this study proves the added value of TLS for tree species classification but also shows that TLS opens up potential for testing and further development of ecological theory.}

ABSTRACT = {Applications of lidar in ecosystem conservation and management continue to expand as technology has rapidly evolved. An accounting of relative accuracy and errors among lidar platforms within a range of forest types and structural configurations was needed. Within a ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona, we compare vegetation attributes at the tree-, plot-, and stand-scales derived from three lidar platforms: fixed-wing airborne (ALS), fixed-location terrestrial (TLS), and hand-held mobile laser scanning (MLS). We present a methodology to segment individual trees from TLS and MLS datasets, incorporating eigen-value and density metrics to locate trees, then assigning point returns to trees using a graph-theory shortest-path approach. Overall, we found MLS consistently provided more accurate structural metrics at the tree- (e.g., mean absolute error for DBH in cm was 4.8, 5.0, and 9.1 for MLS, TLS and ALS, respectively) and plot-scale (e.g., R2 for field observed and lidar-derived basal area, m2 ha−1, was 0.986, 0.974, and 0.851 for MLS, TLS, and ALS, respectively) as compared to ALS and TLS. While TLS data produced estimates similar to MLS, attributes derived from TLS often underpredicted structural values due to occlusion. Additionally, ALS data provided accurate estimates of tree height for larger trees, yet consistently missed and underpredicted small trees (≤35 cm). MLS produced accurate estimates of canopy cover and landscape metrics up to 50 m from plot center. TLS tended to underpredict both canopy cover and patch metrics with constant bias due to occlusion. Taking full advantage of minimal occlusion effects, MLS data consistently provided the best individual tree and plot-based metrics, with ALS providing the best estimates for volume, biomass, and canopy cover. Overall, we found MLS data logistically simple, quickly acquirable, and accurate for small area inventories, assessments, and monitoring activities. We suggest further work exploring the active use of MLS for forest monitoring and inventory.},

abstract = {Abstract Many recent studies have explored remote sensing approaches to facilitate non-destructive sampling of aboveground biomass (AGB). Lidar platforms (e.g., iPhone and iPad PRO models) have recently made remote sensing technologies widely available and present an alternative to traditional approaches for estimating AGB. Lidar approaches can be completed within a fraction of the time required by many analog methods. However, it is unknown if handheld sensors are capable of accurately predicting AGB or how different modeling techniques affect prediction accuracy. Here, we collected AGB from 0.25-m2 plots (N = 45) from three sites along an elevational gradient within rangelands surrounding Flagstaff, Arizona, USA. Each plot was scanned with a mobile laser scanner (MLS) and iPad before plants were clipped, dried, and weighed. We compared the capability of iPad and MLS sensors to estimate AGB via minimization of model normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). This process was performed on predictor subsets describing structural, spectral, and field-based characteristics across a suite of modeling approaches including simple linear, stepwise, lasso, and random forest regression. We found that models developed from MLS and iPad data were equally capable of predicting AGB (NRMSE 26.6\% and 29.3\%, respectively) regardless of the variable subsets considered. We also found that stepwise regression regularly resulted in the lowest NRMSE. Structural variables were consistently selected during each modeling approach, while spectral variables were rarely included. Field-based variables were important in linear regression models but were not included after variable selection within random forest models. These findings support the notion that remote sensing techniques offer a valid alternative to analog field-based data collection methods. Together, our results demonstrate that data collected using a more widely available platform will perform similarly to a more costly option and outline a workflow for modeling AGB using remote sensing systems alone.},

ABSTRACT = {Fire-prone landscapes found throughout the world are increasingly managed with prescribed fire for a variety of objectives. These frequent low-intensity fires directly impact lower forest strata, and thus estimating surface fuels or understory vegetation is essential for planning, evaluating, and monitoring management strategies and studying fire behavior and effects. Traditional fuel estimation methods can be applied to stand-level and canopy fuel loading; however, local-scale understory biomass remains challenging because of complex within-stand heterogeneity and fast recovery post-fire. Previous studies have demonstrated how single location terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can be used to estimate plot-level vegetation characteristics and the impacts of prescribed fire. To build upon this methodology, co-located single TLS scans and physical biomass measurements were used to generate linear models for predicting understory vegetation and fuel biomass, as well as consumption by fire in a southeastern U.S. pineland. A variable selection method was used to select the six most important TLS-derived structural metrics for each linear model, where the model fit ranged in R2 from 0.61 to 0.74. This study highlights prospects for efficiently estimating vegetation and fuel characteristics that are relevant to prescribed burning via the integration of a single-scan TLS method that is adaptable by managers and relevant for coupled fire–atmosphere models.},

    abstract = {Tree crown volume is a fundamental tree characteristic. It correlates to forest biomass production and most relevant ecosystem and environmental functions, such as carbon sequestration and air pollution reduction. When researching these relationships, it is necessary to clearly define and then quantify tree crown variables in a both accurate and operational manner. In this paper, we review the reported literature on the assessment of tree crown volume. First, we compile the varying definitions of crown volume and other tree crown variables that may be used as inputs to quantify crown volume. Then, we examine the data sources for quantifying these variables, including field measurements, terrestrial photographs, aerial photographs and laser scanning. Furthermore, we compare the published approaches on translating these crown variable measurements into tree crown volume. These approaches include the approximation of simple geometric solids, approaches of computational geometry and voxelization. We also compare the reported accuracies and major challenges of these approaches. From this literature review, the reader may craft a suitable approach for the assessment of crown volume.},

abstract = {Individual tree growth is controlled by numerous factors, but intertree competition is of special importance as it is the only parameter that can be managed by silvicultural measures. Many indices dealing with aboveground interference use geometric standard crown shapes to quantify the competitive strength of neighbors on the target tree. As such crowns do not realistically represent the spatial heterogeneity in the canopy, a terrestrial laser scanner was used to gain detailed information on crown characteristics which may be used for a more precise modeling of the relationship between competition and growth. We examined groups of 5 trees growing in three major geographic regions of Germany to investigate the effect of intra- and interspecific competition for light on basal area growth of target beech trees (Fagus sylvatica). A competition index based on individual crown shapes derived from TLS-data correlated better with target tree growth than an index using conventional geometric crown shape models. Both measures ascribed the highest competitive strength to intraspecific competition. In contrast to the valuable hardwoods for which a slightly lower crown competition was calculated, the conifer species Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) had considerably weaker competitive effects on beech. The growth response of the investigated target trees reflected the strength in competition (highest relative basal area growth of beech if mixed with Scots pine>Norway spruce>valuable hardwoods>intraspecific competition) even though the increment measurements with self-acting dendrometers covered only one vegetation period. Neighborhood diversity and target tree growth were correlated, indicating stronger effects of intra- compared to interspecific interference. The utilization of a terrestrial laser scanner provided insights into canopy structure of the competitive neighborhood that may enhance our understanding of competitive interactions.}
